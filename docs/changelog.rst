0.3 (09/03/2016)
----------------

A major internals refactor has taken place in this release, there are a number of breaking changes:

 - The Image class is now immutable. Previously, "resize" and "crop" operations altered the image in-place but now they now always return a new image leaving the original untouched.
 - There are now multiple Image classes. Each one represents possible state the image can be in (eg, in a file, loaded in Pillow, etc). Operations can return an image in a different class to what the operation was performed on.
 - The "backends" have been renamed to "plugins".
 - A new registry module has been added which can be used for registering new plugins and operations.
 - The "original_format" attribute has been deprecated.

Other changes in this release:

- Added auto_orient operation
