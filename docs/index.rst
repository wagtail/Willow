====================
Willow image library
====================

Willow is a pure Python library that aims to unite many Python imaging libraries under a single interface.

Out of the box, Willow can work with Pillow, Wand or OpenCV. None of these image libraries are required (but you should have either Pillow or Wand installed to use most features). It also has a plugin interface which allows you to add support for more libraries, image formats and operations.
