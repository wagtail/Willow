# Extending Willow

This section describes how to extend Willow with custom operations, image formats
and plugins.

Don't forget to look at the :doc:`concepts </concepts>` section first!

## Implementing new operations

You can add operations to any existing image class and register them by calling the
:meth:`Registry.register_operation` method passing it the image class, name of
the operation and the function to call when the operation is used.

For example, let's implement a ``blur`` operation for both the
:class:`~willow.plugins.pillow.PillowImage` and :class:`~willow.plugins.wand.WandImage`
classes:

```python
from willow.registry import registry
from willow.plugins.pillow import PillowImage
from willow.plugins.wand import WandImage

def pillow_blur(image):
    from PIL import ImageFilter

    blurred_image = image.image.filter(ImageFilter.BLUR)
    return PillowImage(blurred_image)

def wand_blur(image):
    # Wand modifies images in place so clone it first to prevent
    # altering the original image
    blurred_image = image.image.clone()
    blurred_image.gaussian_blur()
    return WandImage(blurred_image)


# Register the operations in Willow

registry.register_operation(PillowImage, 'blur', pillow_blur)
registry.register_operation(WandImage, 'blur', wand_blur)
```

It is not required to support both :class:`~willow.plugins.pillow.PillowImage`
and :class:`~willow.plugins.wand.WandImage` but it's recommended that libraries
support both for maximum compatibility. You must support Wand if you need
animated GIF support.

## Implementing custom image classes

You can create your own image classes and register them by calling the
:meth:`Registry.register_image_class` method. All image classes must be a
subclass of :class:`willow.image.Image`.

Methods on image classes can be decorated with ``@Image.operation``,
``@Image.converter_from`` or ``@Image.converter_to`` which will make Willow
automatically register those methods as operations or converters.

For example, let's implement our own image class for Pillow:

```python
from __future__ import absolute_import

import PIL.Image

from willow.image import (
    Image,
    JPEGImageFile,
    PNGImageFile,
    GIFImageFile,
)


class NewPillowImage(Image):
    def __init__(self, image):
        self.image = image


    # Informational operations

    @Image.operation
    def get_size(self):
        return self.image.size

    @Image.operation
    def has_alpha(self):
        img = self.image
        return img.mode in ('RGBA', 'LA') or (img.mode == 'P' and 'transparency' in img.info)

    @Image.operation
    def has_animation(self):
        # Animation is not supported by PIL
        return False


    # Resize and crop operations

    @Image.operation
    def resize(self, size):
        return PillowImage(image.resize(size, PIL.Image.ANTIALIAS))

    @Image.operation
    def crop(self, rect):
        return PillowImage(self.image.crop(rect))


    # Converter from supported file formats, this is where the image is opened

    # Pillow doesn't support GIFs very well. Adding a cost will make Willow try
    # a different image class first. The default cost for all converters is 100.

    @classmethod
    @Image.converter_from(JPEGImageFile)
    @Image.converter_from(PNGImageFile)
    @Image.converter_from(GIFImageFile, cost=200)
    @Image.converter_from(BMPImageFile)
    def open(cls, image_file):
        image_file.f.seek(0)
        image = PIL.Image.open(image_file.f)

        return cls(image)
```

The image class can then be registered by calling :meth:`Registry.register_image_class`:

```python
from willow.registry import registry

from newpillow import NewPillowImage

registry.register_image_class(NewPillowImage)
```

This will also register all operations and converters defined on the class.

## Plugins

Plugins allow multiple image classes and/or operations to be registered together.
They are Python modules with any of the following attributes defined:
``willow_image_classes``, ``willow_operations`` or ``willow_converters``.

For example, we can convert the Python module in the example above into a Willow
plugin by adding the following line at the bottom of the file:

```python
willow_image_operations = [NewPillowImage]
```

It can now be registered using the :meth:`Registry.register_plugin` method:

```python
from willow.registry import registry

import newpillow

registry.register_plugin(newpillow)
```
