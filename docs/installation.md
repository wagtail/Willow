# Installation

Willow supports Python 2.7+ and 3.3+. It's a pure-python library with no hard
dependencies so doesn't require a C compiler for a basic installation.

## Installation using ``pip``

```shell
pip install Willow
```

## Installing underlying libraries

In order for most features of Willow to work, you need to install either Pillow
or Wand.

 - `Pillow installation <http://pillow.readthedocs.org/en/3.0.x/installation.html#basic-installation>`_
 - `Wand installation <http://docs.wand-py.org/en/0.4.2/guide/install.html>`_

Note that Pillow doesn't support animated GIFs and Wand isn't as fast.
Installing both will give best results.
